# Security Fix: Removed Hardcoded Supabase Service Key

## Issue
The GitHub security scanning detected a hardcoded Supabase service key in the migration file `supabase/migrations/20240108234540_setup.sql`. This is a security vulnerability as service keys should never be committed to version control.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Removed Hardcoded Service Key
- **File**: `supabase/migrations/20240108234540_setup.sql`
- **Change**: Replaced hardcoded service key with environment variable configuration
- **Before**: `service_role_key TEXT := 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...'`
- **After**: `service_role_key := current_setting('app.supabase_service_role_key', true);`

### 2. Updated Later Migration
- **File**: `supabase/migrations/20250111000000_fix_storage_deletion.sql`
- **Change**: Removed hardcoded fallback service key
- **Before**: Fallback to hardcoded key if environment variable not set
- **After**: Raises exception if environment variable not configured

### 3. Added Configuration Function
- **File**: `supabase/migrations/20250111000002_create_config_setter.sql`
- **Purpose**: Creates a function to safely set the service role key configuration
- **Security**: Function is marked as `SECURITY DEFINER` and only accessible to authenticated users

### 4. Updated File Deletion API
- **File**: `app/api/files/[fileId]/route.ts`
- **Change**: Added configuration setup before attempting file deletion
- **Purpose**: Ensures the storage deletion function has access to the service role key

## Security Improvements

1. **No Hardcoded Secrets**: All service keys are now loaded from environment variables
2. **Runtime Configuration**: Service key is set at runtime, not in migration files
3. **Error Handling**: Functions fail gracefully if configuration is missing
4. **Audit Trail**: Configuration setup is logged for debugging

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure these environment variables are set in your deployment:

```bash
# Required for Supabase configuration
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url_here
```

## Deployment Notes

1. **Vercel**: Add the environment variables in your Vercel project settings
2. **Local Development**: Add them to your `.env.local` file
3. **Production**: Ensure the service role key is properly secured in your production environment

## Verification

After deployment, verify that:
1. File deletion works correctly
2. No hardcoded secrets appear in GitHub security scanning
3. Environment variables are properly configured
